## Hello!

I am currently a student at Leeds Beckett University studying MEng Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. I specialise in making programming needlessly stressful, and complicated.

My programming experience is solely with python, and I would consider myself a mediocre programmer.

My main interest is offensive security, and I have several CTFs under my belt.
